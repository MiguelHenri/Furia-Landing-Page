## ðŸŽ® How to Run

Make sure you have all `.env` files configured correctly. Take a look at `.env.example`.

In the `backend` directory, build the website by running the following:
```bash
$ (pip install -r requirements.txt) && (cd ../frontend && npm install && npm run build)
```
> You may use a python environment.

Now, again in the `backend` directory, run the website:
```bash
$ gunicorn -w 4 app:app
```
